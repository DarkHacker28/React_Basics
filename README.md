# React Basics Project

## Description
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to React and Node.js. It demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as components, state, and props, as well as how to set up a basic Node.js backend for serving API requests. The project includes examples of simple interactive features and shows how React integrates with a backend server.

## Features
- **React Components:** Modular and reusable UI components.
- **State Management:** Examples of stateful components.
- **Props Usage:** Passing data between components.
- **Node.js Backend:** A simple Express server to handle API requests.
- **API Integration:** Fetching data from the backend and displaying it in the frontend.
- **Styling:** Basic CSS for styling the application.
